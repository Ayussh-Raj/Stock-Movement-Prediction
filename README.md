# Stock Price Prediction using Hybrid Market Knowledge Graphs & Dual Attention Networks

## 📌 Introduction
This project focuses on **predicting stock movements** by leveraging a **bi-typed hybrid-relational market knowledge graph** and **Dual Attention Networks (DAN)**. The approach integrates **graph-based modeling** and **deep learning techniques** to improve accuracy in financial market predictions.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Construct a **market knowledge graph** incorporating stock and executive relationships.
- Used **Momentum spillover effect** for better model.
- Utilize **Dual Attention Networks (DAN)** for feature extraction and relation learning.
- Enhance prediction accuracy using **graph-based deep learning methods**.
- Implement and evaluate the model in **PyTorch Geometric**.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Deep Learning Framework**: PyTorch Geometric
- **Graph Processing**: NetworkX
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
- **Data Handling**: Pickle, Pandas

## 🚀 Installation & Setup
### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio torch-geometric numpy scikit-learn matplotlib networkx dill
```

### 2️⃣ Download the Dataset
Ensure the **data** folder contains processed stock and executive relations.

### 3️⃣ Run the Training Script
```bash
python main1.py
```

## 🔍 Execution Workflow
### 📌 Data Processing
- Load **stock-executive interaction data** (`interactive.pkl`).
- Construct **market knowledge graphs** (explicit & implicit relations).
- Generate **graph-based features** for model training.

### 📌 Model Training
- Utilize **Dual Attention Networks (DAN)** for feature extraction.
- Train the model on **hybrid-relational graph data**.
- Optimize using **Adam optimizer** and **cross-entropy loss**.

### 📌 Model Evaluation
- Evaluate **AUC** (Area Under Curve) and **Accuracy** on test data.
- Example output from training:
  ```
  epoch32, train_loss=0.6495, eval_auc=0.5456, eval_acc=0.5189, test_auc=0.5516, test_acc=0.5274
  epoch50, train_loss=0.6014, eval_auc=0.5468, eval_acc=0.5356, test_auc=0.5325, test_acc=0.5233
  ```

## 📊 Results Visualization
- The model constructs **market knowledge graphs** showing **stocks & executive relations**.
- Performance metrics (AUC, accuracy) are plotted to assess training progress.
- Example **knowledge graph visualization**:
  ```python
  import networkx as nx
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  G = nx.Graph()
  # Add stock & executive nodes, then visualize the graph
  nx.draw(G, with_labels=True, node_size=600, font_size=8)
  plt.show()
  ```

## 🔥 Challenges & Solutions
